Hello! This is the official repository of FTC Team 6382 ("Wrench Monkeys".) As of the present time, it is mostly maintained by David Conover. Questions should be directed to him.

An official repository of [Windsor High School Robotics](https://github.com/WindsorHSRobotics). Forked from [FtcRobotController](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController).

A big thank you also goes out to the following:
* [The OpenFTC Team for EasyOpenCV](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV) and [The EOVC AprilTags Plugin](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EOCV-AprilTag-Plugin)
* [The FTC Discord](https://discord.com/invite/first-tech-challenge) for suffering all of my (probably annoying) newbie questions.
* The amazing members of my team. Times have been tough thru the season, but I know that I always have strong, respectable, and sometimes humorous people I can rely upon. 

The tool-using simians of Wrench Monkeys are:
Kian, Chase, David, Abrar, Zale, Lincoln
