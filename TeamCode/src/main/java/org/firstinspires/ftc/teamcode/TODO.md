TODO

1. Get autonmous scoring at least 25 points. Top priority. Discuss with the team on autonomous strategy.

2. Change the arm system so that it can be stopped at certain points (the highest pole currently available on the field, for instance.) This should hopefully help Chase have less of a panic attack in endgame.

3. Figure out what's causing the short(?) (10/3/22)
